Problem : 
-Create a program that prompts for your name and prints a greeting using name.

Constraint 
-Keep the input, string concatenation and output separate

What else about this classic for coding beginners?

This type of file will be general question that I would ask myself in order to understand a problem.

-What should the program display on the screen when it starts? 
-Should the user be able to modify the input? 
-Do I want to see a name and more informations?

Example :

What do you want to display? Hello World
