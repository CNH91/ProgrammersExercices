Problem :
Create a program that prompts for a input string and displays output that shows the input string and the number of characters the string contains.

Constraint : 
-Be sure the output contains the original string
-Use a single output statement to construct the output
-Use a built-in function of the programming language to determing the length of the string

General Questions:

Should the string be formatted when the user enters symbols?
Should we trim the spaces?
