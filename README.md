### Programmers Exercices
This repository is a fun project that will include 57 differents challenges 

I will be coding these challenge in C++ mostly on Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 and some challenges will probably be on Visual Studio Code, trying to learn all the functionality that those coding tools provide. I will provide documents of my thought process. I will update this readme file progressively. If you have different insight, patterns or solutions, feel free to contribute! It's all about having fun and enjoying solving problems!
