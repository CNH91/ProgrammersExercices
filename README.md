This repository is a fun project that will include 57 differents challenges. 
Book : Exercises for Programmers - 57 Challanges to Develop your Coding Skills - Brian P. Hogan 

# Pre-requisites and Installation

* Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 Community Edition - [Download page](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/fr/downloads/?rr=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F)

# Purpose 

I will be coding these challenge in C++ mostly on Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 and some challenges will probably be on Visual Studio Code, trying to learn all the functionality that those coding tools provide. I will update this readme file progressively. 

 I will provide documents of my thought process. The goal of this project is to follow these rules :
   1 - Understand the Problem
   2 - Discoving Inputs, Processes, and Outputs
   3 - Driving Design with Tests
   4 - Writing the Algorithm in Pseudocode
   5 - Writing the Code 
   6 - Challenge (which are provided by the book, but I will push the limit and add files, database and different plateform!)

If you have different insight, patterns or solutions, feel free to contribute! 
It's all about having fun and enjoying solving problems!
